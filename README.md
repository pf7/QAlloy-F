# QAlloy-F

QAlloy-F is the fuzzy component of a general-purpose quantitative extension to Alloy, which can be used to design and analyse high-level relational models of various kinds of fuzzy problems.

A pre-built QAlloy-F JAR is provided [here](https://github.com/pf7/QAlloy-F/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

This repository is organized as follows:
* [qalloy](https://github.com/pf7/QAlloy-F/tree/main/qalloy#readme) contains the source code of the QAlloy-F extension.
* [fis2als](https://github.com/pf7/QAlloy-F/tree/main/fis2als#readme) provides a prototype program that generates QAlloy-F models for fuzzy inference systems.
* [benchmark](https://github.com/pf7/QAlloy-F/tree/main/benchmark#readme) contains examples of models for different kinds of fuzzy problems as well as a benchmarking script to evaluate the tool's performance.
